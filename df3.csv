"@AmericanAir It's not the delay to the gates. It's saying, ""Well, the DOT counts this as an on-time arrival.""

@AmericanAir Too bad you still left a woman and her 2 kids at the gate when the plane didn‚Äôt even leave the gate for another 30mins after their first flight was delayed ‚Äúdue to mechanical issues‚Äù and then won‚Äôt even guarantee them another flight. How pathetic to claim you care then pull this.,negative
@AmericanAir I expect nothing less than a partial refund of my $970 fair that I paid since you were more than willing to give money credits ahead of time as  you were already overbooked. In my twenty plus years of traveling on US Air and American I never missed a flight,negative
